            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>
                The <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Lancer_Evolution">Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution</a>,also known as 'Evo', is a sports sedan based on the Lancer that was manufactured by Japanesemanufacturer Mitsubishi
                Motors from 1992until 2016. There have been ten official versions to date, and the designation of each model is mostcommonly a Roman numeral. All use two litre turbocharged inline four-cylinder engines and all-wheeldrive systems. The Evolution
                was originallyintended only for Japanese markets, but demand on the "grey import" market led the Evolution series to beoffered through Ralliart dealer networks in the United Kingdom and in various European markets fromaround 1998. Mitsubishi
                decidedto export the eighth generation Evolution to the United States in 2003 after witnessing the successSubaru had in that market with their long-time direct rival, the Subaru Impreza WRX STi.Japanese-spec[citation needed] versions of
                allEvos until the release of the Evo IX in 2005 were limited by a gentlemen's agreement to advertise nomore than 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp). However, sources say Mitsubishi had already been producing cars withmore power but had been underratingthe
                official power outputs in order to be in compliance with the agreement. Therefore, each subsequentversion has unofficially evolved above the advertised power figures, with the Japanese-spec Evolution IXreaching an alleged outputof around
                321 PS (236 kW; 317 hp). Various versions available in other markets, particularly the UK,have official power outputs up to 446 PS (328 kW; 440 hp). The tenth and final generation of the LancerEvolution (Evo X) was launchedin Japan in
                2007, and overseas markets in 2008. The Evo X was produced for almost 10 years until itretired in April 2016.
